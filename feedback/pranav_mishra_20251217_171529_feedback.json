  "feedback": "## 1. Role-Anchored Summary\n\nAs an entry-level AI Engineer, the interviewer is looking for candidates who can demonstrate foundational knowledge of AI principles, articulate their project experiences clearly, and connect their background to the role effectively. You showcased enthusiasm for AI and relevant project work, particularly with your Snake AI project. However, many of your responses contained vague language and lacked specific metrics or structured explanations that would help convey your technical depth and problem-solving abilities. The key growth area is to present your experiences in a more structured and quantifiable manner.\n\n## 2. Competency Scores\n\n| Competency            | Score | Quick Take                                         |\n|-----------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Technical Depth       | 3/5   | Relevant project experience but lacks metrics      |\n| Problem-Solving       | 3/5   | Demonstrated understanding but needs clearer challenges |\n| Communication Clarity | 2/5   | Responses were often unclear and rambling          |\n\n## 3. Key Strengths (2-3 items)\n\n**Project Experience in AI**\nYou have hands-on experience with reinforcement learning and AI projects, indicating a foundational understanding of the field.\n*\"I would say that there is one project called Snake AI MLOps, which is basically a reinforcement learning project where I trained a game agent's snake to play the classic snake game.\"*\nThis matters because practical experience is crucial for entry-level roles, showcasing your ability to apply theoretical knowledge.\n\n**Passion for AI and Game Design**\nYour enthusiasm for both AI and game design shows a personal investment in your career path.\n*\"I loved playing games as a child... I wanted to make games when I grew up.\"*\nThis matters because passion can be a strong motivator for success in the field, indicating you'll be engaged and willing to learn.\n\n## 4. Development Areas (3-4 items)\n\n**Quantifying Project Impact**\n*You said: \"the whole I think my point was like, checking the latency and the average scores of these, uh, agents.\"*\n**Micro-technique**: Always include specific metrics when discussing project outcomes. Instead of saying \"checking the latency,\" say, \"I measured the average latency at 150ms and compared the agent scores, which improved by 20% over baseline.\" Before answering, think of one quantifiable result you can share.\n\n**Clarity and Structure in Responses**\n*Your explanation of the Snake AI project was long and convoluted: \"But doing it in UI mean meant it was a challenge, which was you had to run the models in the background in the inference.\"*\n**Micro-technique**: Use a \"Situation → Action → Result\" structure. For example, say: \"The challenge was running models in the background for real-time inference. I developed a UI to visualize this, which allowed us to track model performance more effectively.\" Practice this structure until it feels natural.\n\n**Reducing Filler Language**\n*You frequently used filler phrases, such as \"like,\" \"uh,\" and \"basically.\"*\n**Micro-technique**: Replace filler words with confident pauses. For example, instead of saying \"I have worked with REX, multi agent systems, and other stuff,\" pause briefly, then say confidently, \"I have worked with REX and multi-agent systems, focusing on practical applications.\" Record your answers and aim to reduce the use of fillers by 50% in practice sessions.\n\n## 5. Answer Rewrite Example\n\n**Original Answer:**\n*\"So for the chatbot, we had a basically, a really compact MCP tool, and I worked on making it better, and we used some AI stuff to make it respond faster.\"*\n\n**Improved Version:**\n\"In my Snake AI project, I implemented a reinforcement learning model to train a game agent. The primary challenge was ensuring real-time performance, which I measured by tracking latency and agent scores. I achieved a latency of 150ms while increasing the agent's average score by 20% through iterative training and optimization.\"\n\n**What Changed:**\n- Removed filler words (\"basically,\" \"stuff\")\n- Added specific numbers (150ms, 20%)\n- Used clear structure: Situation → Challenge → Action → Result\n\n## 6. Practice Plan (1-2 Weeks)\n\n**Week 1: Foundation**\n\nDaily Exercises (15 min/day):\n- Write a 3-sentence summary for your top 3 projects using the format: \"I built X. The challenge was Y. The result was Z (with a number).\"\n- Record yourself answering \"Tell me about a project you worked on\" and count filler words. Goal: < 3 per minute.\n\nPractice Questions (tied to your weak areas):\n1. [For quantifying impact] \"What was the most significant improvement you achieved in any of your projects?\"\n2. [For technical depth] \"Describe how you approached a challenging technical problem in your work.\"\n3. [For communication clarity] \"Explain a complex concept from your AI studies to someone without a technical background.\"\n\n**Week 2: Polish**\n\nExercises:\n- Conduct 2 mock interviews with a friend; focus on concise answers and clear structure.\n- Write out 3 STAR stories with specific metrics. Memorize the key numbers and practice delivering them smoothly.\n- Refine your \"elevator pitch\" for your background and projects until it's under 60 seconds.\n\nPractice Questions (role-specific):\n4. [For this role] \"How would you apply reinforcement learning to a new problem?\"\n5. [For this role] \"Can you describe a time when you had to debug an AI model?\"",
